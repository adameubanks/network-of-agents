## Key Findings

✅ **High Success Rate**: Most simulations completed successfully
❌ **Poor Convergence**: Few simulations showed clear convergence
✅ **Balanced Results**: No strong systematic bias detected

## Recommendations

1. **For High-Fidelity Topics**: Use these topics for reliable LLM-based simulations
2. **For Problematic Topics**: Investigate sources of bias or non-convergence
3. **Model Calibration**: Consider adjusting parameters for better convergence
4. **Statistical Validation**: Use confidence intervals for robust estimates
5. **Further Analysis**: Run additional experiments with different configurations
