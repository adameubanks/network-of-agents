\item \textbf{Pride Flag Topics:}
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Agent 23:} ``I'm weighing classroom decor decisions, and I lean toward banning the pride flag from the classroom to keep focus on learning. I want a respectful, inclusive space for all students without political symbols dominating the walls.''
  \end{quote}
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Agent 7:} ``I hung a pride flag in our classroom today, a small banner that tells every student they belong. Banning it would hide voices we need to hear; inclusion is part of real education.''
  \end{quote}
\item \textbf{10 Commandments Topics:}
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Agent 15:} ``I favor banning the Ten Commandments from being hung in classrooms. Public schools should stay neutral and inclusive for all students.''
  \end{quote}
  \begin{quote}
  \textbf{Agent 42:} ``Personally, I support hanging the Ten Commandments in the classroom, not banning them, because it reflects history and fosters discussion. It should be presented with context for all beliefs.''

\textbf{Chocolate v Vanilla:}

\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Agent 6:} ``Vanilla ice cream wins for me—it's silky, versatile, and lets all the toppings shine without stealing the show. Chocolate is nice, but vanilla keeps my desserts classy and crowd-pleasing.''

\textbf{Circles v Triangles:}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Agent 18:} ``I'm team triangles today: sharp angles, clear lines, and ideas that stack neatly. Circles feel calm, but triangles push momentum and structure where chaos used to be.''
\end{quote}
